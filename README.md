## How we built it

We started by communicating with the customer and understanding the purpose in depth. I then designed the prototype and layout of the page in Figma. After prioritising, we divided the scope of work into small parts, which we distributed to the developers.

We made an adaptive page, used the SASS preprocessor, employed JS and worked with BEM.
<br>
<br>

## Challenges we ran into

We wanted to implement this project as best we could. 
This was the customer's first experience of working with developers. In a short space of time, I had to do the work of a marketer, a copywriter  and a designer in order to start developing the page directly.

Communication and clear results were key, especially with our big time difference
<br>
<br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We had an incredible experience working with the customer and the team. We pulled it off and are very proud to have created a beautiful, modern and functional adaptive website.
